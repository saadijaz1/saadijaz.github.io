                This project entailed the extraction of real estate data from Zillow, specifically targeting properties in Calgary, AB. We developed a predictive model capable of estimating property prices based on critical variables such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, postal code, and property type. Approximately 900 listings from Calgary, AB were meticulously scraped to gather detailed information, enabling the quantification of these variables. We evaluated various regression models, including Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors, to identify the most effective predictive algorithm. The final model was deployed using Flask, with "Render" serving as the web hosting platform.
