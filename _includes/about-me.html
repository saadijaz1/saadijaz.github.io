<span class="red">Hi there!</span>

<p>
As a dynamic professional with a unique blend of expertise in both civil engineering and machine learning, I bring a results-driven approach to complex problem-solving and data analysis. My career journey reflects a robust combination of hands-on construction industry experience and a passionate transition to the field of machine learning and data analytics. This unique pathway has been marked by a commitment to continuous learning and adaptability, enabling me to excel in roles that require both technical acumen and strategic thinking.

My professional experience spans over six years, beginning in the construction industry where I specialized in project estimation, forecasting, and tracking. Key roles have included serving as a Project Engineer and Estimator at Zachry Construction Corporation, USA, and as a Lecturer and Deputy Assistant Director at the National University of Technology, Pakistan. The transition to machine learning was marked by my tenure as an Associate Machine Learning Developer at AltaML Inc., Canada. Here, I executed critical projects like developing a proof of concept for a solar radiation prediction system and creating end-to-end scalable pipelines for data processing and visualization. These roles have not only honed my technical skills but also sharpened my leadership and project management capabilities.

On the technical front, I am proficient in a wide array of tools and languages that are pivotal in the realms of data science and machine learning. These include Python (with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Stats Model, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Seaborn), SQL, Tableau, Microsoft Azure, Git, Docker, and Power BI. Additionally, I am well-versed in Agile methodologies, Scrum, Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and the Software Development Life Cycle. My educational background, with a Master’s in Civil Engineering from Texas A&M University and a Bachelor’s in Civil Engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology, has laid a strong foundation for my technical and analytical capabilities.
